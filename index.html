			<p><h3><u>The Problem<br></u></h3></p>
			<p><h4>When you are cooking and you happen to have extra oil, what
			do you do? Well from our knowledge, most women (or for that matter,
			anyone that cooks) just pours the oil down any drain like the sink,
			toilet, or even the bathtub. Well in case you didn't realize, that
			is not good. It can cause basement flooding and i don't think anyone
			wants that. That leads us to our problem. Where do you put your extra
			oil?  Definitely not those places!<br></h4></p>
			<p><h3><u>Existing Solutions<br></u></h3></p>
			<p><h4>What you could do is buy a fat trapper. You open a bag called
			a fat trapper and pour the oil in. It stands so nobody needs to hold
			it for you when you are pouring the oil in it. Pretty simple, right?
			It is but the problem with those is that you need to buy a lot of them
			which might be kind of expensive. Every time you will need to pour your
			oil in a different bag. Another idea is to take an extra container that
			you have and put it in and then freeze it and throw it out but what if
			you don't have and extra container or you don't have space in your 
			freezer? The pizza stores already have a good idea. They put their oil
			in a big barrel that gets picked up and goes soewhere to get disposed
			of. We thought of an idea for home-baked extra oil because you usually
			don't have that much extra oil. Here is our idea.<br></h4></p>
			<p><h3><u>Our Solution/Invention<br></u></h3></p>
			<p><h4>We decided to make something simple and not too expensive. We 
			thought that the extra oil can be poured into a plastic bag that has
			foil in it.(You put the foil in it yourself.) Then, to make it easier
			to pour the oil in, we made this holder to hold the bag  so nobody has
			to hold the bag for you while you are pouring it in. When you are done
			pouring the oil in, you zip up the plastic bag and throw it out. If you
			don't zip or close the bag, it will leak in your garbage bag and make 
			things very complecated so make sure to close your plastic bag. The foil
			is there because if it is hot oil then the foil will make sure the plastic
			bag won't melt. Here is a picture of our holder.<br></h4></p>

			<p><h4>Then here are some pictures of the plastic bag in it and with the
			foil and how it looks when you close the bag.<br></h4></p>
